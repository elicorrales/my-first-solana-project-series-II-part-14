# my-first-solana-project-series-II-part-14

## In this video we learn how to (or review how to)
- generate a keypair file from Bash command line
- pass in command-line arguments the JSON keypair array (a string) to a Javascript client
- convert passed-in ascii string into real JSON array, so as to pass them to the Solana "TransactionInstruction" and thus "sendTransaction" and thus be received by the deployed on-chain Rust program
